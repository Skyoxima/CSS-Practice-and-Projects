            <p>⚝ By default all HTML elements have the position property as 'static'. It is the regular flow of positioning in HTML.</p>
            <p>⚝ Relative position is similar to static but it allows for using the 'top', 'left', 'right' and 'bottom' properties.<br>
            These properties make the element dislocate from it's static position to whatever is specified.<br>
            Relative positioning causes the original space to still be taken up. This can cause overflowing of one element onto the next one.</p>
            <p>⚝ Absolute position takes the element out of the normal document flow completely. No space is left in place of the actual element like it does in relative positioning.</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(142, 0, 0); text-decoration: 1px solid underline;">
                Absolute position by default 'absolutely' positions the element it is applied to. By that it means that it will take the 'body' as the 'parent' of the element.<br>
                To have a <span style="color: red; text-decoration: 1px double underline;">absolutely positioned child element</span> inside a parent element, the <span style="color: red; text-decoration: 1px double underline;">parent element</span> has not to be static but <span style="color: red; text-decoration: 1px double underline;">anything else (relative, absolute, sticky, fixed).</span>
            </p>
            <p>⚝ Fixed position works and behaves like Absolute position only thing is that when the page is scrolled, the element still stays right where it was initially throughout the page.</p>
            <p>⚝ Sticky positioning is essentially a combination of Relative and Fixed positioning. The element will be relatively positioned initially and then becomes fixed when the element is at the top of the parent while scrolling.</p>

<!-- couldn't get the sticky position to work with just the child element ~ could only do it when the parent's height was changed to 200vh and not body's -->
